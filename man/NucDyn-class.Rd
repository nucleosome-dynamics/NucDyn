\title{Nucleosome Dynamics calculation.}
\value{
An instance of the class \code{NucDyn} representing the output of
\code{\link[=nucleosomeDynamics]{nucleosomeDynamics()}}.
}
\description{
This class represents the result of running \code{nucleosomeDynamics} on two
reference sets.
}
\details{
Intances of this class contain two \code{GRangesList} objects, each with
information about how reads were classified in each input dataset.  The
fields of each \code{GRangesList} object are (with some exceptions*):
\itemize{
\item originals: All reads used for the analysis, after removing long reads
defined by maxLen parameter.
\item coinciding: Reads that have an exact match in the other set and are
considered to be the same read.
\item same.start: Reads whose match in the other set starts at the same position
but ends in a different one. They are considered to be a consequence of
experimental differences.
\item same.end: Reads whose match in the other set ends at the same position but
starts in a different one. They are considered to be a consequence of
experimental differences.
\item containedA: Reads in the set B which are totally contained by
their match in the set A. Or reads in the set A that totally contain
their match in the set B. They are considered to be a
consequence of experimental differences.
\item containedB: Reads in the set A which are totally contained by
their match in the set B. Or reads in the set B that totally contain
their match in the set A. They are considered to be a
consequence of experimental differences.
\item small.shifts: Upstream or downstream shifts shorter than minDiff.
\item left.shifts: Shifts that suffer an upstream shift when considering
transition from the set A to the set B.
\item right.shifts: Shifts that suffer a downstream shift when considering
transition from the set A to the set B.
\item indels: Reads that are not present in the other set due to an insertion or
deletion event. If they are in set A, they are considered a deletion and
if they are in set B, they are considered an insertion.
\item unpaired: Reads that are uniformly and randomly removed from the set with
more reads to account for differences in the number of reads between sets.
}

*: the types "same.start", "same.end", "containedA" and "containedB" will
not be present if in the call of \code{nucleosomeDynamics}, \code{equalSize=TRUE}.
